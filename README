This is a fork of Octopi, a powerful Pacman/Yaourt frontend using Qt libs. 
=========================================================================

This is just a fork for experimental and educational purposes.

For the REAL (working) thing please look at: 
	https://github.com/aarnt/octopi

The fork's source code is hosted at 
	https://github.com/tbinkau/octopi.

You'll need a privilege escalation tool to use it, once running as 
root will ONLY work in KDE. Octopi supports kdesu and gksu for that.

Do you understand english? Wanna help this project?
You can translate it to your mother language at 
	https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/octopi/.

Enjoy!
